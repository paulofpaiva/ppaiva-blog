        <p>
          Hey there! I&apos;m Paulo Paiva, a 22-year-old software developer from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started programming in 2022 and since then I&apos;ve been working with full-stack development. 
          On the frontend, I mostly work with React.js, Next.js, JavaScript, and CSS. 
          On the backend, I focus on C#, .NET, REST & Minimal APIs, Swagger/OpenAPI, and architectural patterns like MVC and CQRS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have experience with databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle PL/SQL, QuestDB, Supabase, and Firebase, as well as cloud and DevOps tools like Git, AWS (EC2, RDS, S3), Docker, IIS, Fly.io, Vercel, Render, and Railway.
        </p>
        <p>
        I&apos;m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. If you&apos;re hiring or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out!
